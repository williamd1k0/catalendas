It's that one!
That, Capuchin, is Orion's Belt!
Aaw... I can't see anything, Ms. Sloth...
There, Capuchin. Try to concentrate a little bit.
Oh... I'm trying, but I can't, Ms. Sloth...
In the sky, I can only see, um... the Three Sisters!
See, that's it! The Three Sisters are part of Orion's Belt.
They stay right in the middle. The Belt is a square.
I see... but why do they call it Orion's Belt, Ms. Sloth?
That's because of an old legend, Capuchin. All ancient civilizations had their unique way of observing the sky.
Orion, for instance, was a hunter. He is in the sky along with two other constellations, the Greater Dog, and the Lesser Dog.
Whoa, there are dogs in the sky!?
No, Capuchin! The many positions of the stars form figures, even of animals. Since the beginning of the world, the sky served as map, calendar and even clock.
Huh? Clock?
Looking at the fourth Sister. Ms. Sloth, can you tell me what time is it?
Fourth Sister?
Yeah! Look there...
One...{w=1.0} two...{w=1.0} three...{w=1.0} and that one just by the side is the fourth Sister!
No, Capuchin! There are only three Sisters. That fourth star is something else entirely.
To the indigenous, for example, that one is called Panhaom.
Panhaom?
That's right. It means bacurau in the language of the Tupari tribe.
I still don't get it...
Bacurau is a bird, Capuchin.
Ooh, I know the one! It only comes out at night, like Matinta Perera.
Right you are. That star was named like this because of Tianoá.
And who was Tianoá?
It is an old Tupari legend. Tianoá became known as The Flying Head.
Egad...!! A flying head!!
Yes. Let me get my book to tell you this tale.
Uuh... A flying head. I hadn't heard of this one yet.

Tianoá was the village's most beautiful maiden.
Married to Guatapapi, son of the Shaman and one of the first beings to ever exist.
Hmmm... Me arranged good marriage for my son! With beautiful woman!
Shaman son will have beautiful and strong descendants!
Shaman race staying forever on Earth.
But there was something the Shaman did not know. Actually, nobody knew.
Every night, Tianoá's head would leave her body and fly around other people's crops, eating whatever showed up in front of her.
Only her head? And just where would the food go??
That... nobody knew.
Before dawn, the head would return and attach itself to Tianoá's body once again.
Guatapapi gonna hunt good food today, for Tianoá to eat!
Tianoá is happy with Guatapapi, enough to fill me inside.
Strange, Guatapapi wake up everyday with blood on chest.
Mosquitoes. At night, Tianoá kills a lot of 'em over Guatapapi.
Ooh, my love!
Umm... let's get outta here!
Quiet! Today I find out why Guatapapi wakes up with that blood on his chest!
You really think Tianoá would dare cutting the chest of the Shaman's son?
Dunno! But there must be a reason for him to bleed in the mornings!
That's not the case! It's not his blood!
Well, how can you tell?
I asked him before! There's no bruise at all!
Then it must be what I'm thinking!
What?
W I T C H C R A F T!!
Are you mad? We should really get outta here!
If the Shaman sees us spying on his son, he will punish us!
Oh shut it, scaredy cat! You know what I found out?
No, and I don't wanna know!
Tianoá puts her blood in the holy drink!
What? In the holy drink?
That's why she doesn't like anyone looking at her, when she prepares it!
Her blood? Uuugh!
She cuts her own finger and lets blood into the drink!
Uuugh!
Look! Something is going on over there!
Now we discover Tianoá's secret!
What is that??
Unbelievable!!
Let's get outta here fast!
She's coming near!

And did the head catch the children?
No, Capuchin. They were fast and smart!
Oh, and then what?
They immediately ran to the Shaman and told him about it.
Hmm... I have a feeling the Shaman didn't believe them, and they got grounded.
Not really! He did believe. And was furious about it!
Everyone was furious about it.
So, did they get her head and threw it so high it became a star?
Calm down, Capuchin, we are barely getting started.
Ah... it's just that I'm getting kinda afraid, Ms. Sloth...
No need to fear, Capuchin. Listen to the rest of the story.
Then, the Shaman had an idea. He summoned everyone and decided to have a party that night.
Everyone got out to gather the firewood for a huge bonfire.
The Shaman planned the party to happen only by the morning. So the bonfire stood there, ready to be kindled.
Everyone was waiting.
And then they took Tianoá's body and put it into the bonfire.
Tianoá! Tianoá! What are you doing to my beloved woman?
She has betrayed our tribe, my son!
She steals food from other people!
But we love each other!
Well, we do know she loses her head for you.
Let's burn this sinful body already.
Aaaaaghhhh!!!
My love!! My love!! My looove!!
It has been two days since Tianoá is gone...
Guatapapi unable to sleep well...
Accursed bird! Guatapapi gonna kill you!
No! I am your woman, still in love with you, my love!
My woman looked nothing like this!
I became like this after they burned me, my beloved.
I am here to take you!
What!
My father and my brother are outside, they are here to invite you to live in our village up in the skies, it's very pretty.
Me not keen on trusting accursed birds.
How is Guatapapi gonna you're not a bacurau trying to kill me?
Are you convinced now?
Tianoá? My love!
My dad has made a vine so we can climb up to the sky.
Let's go, my love! Come with me!
Tianoá's relatives made her into a star.
Whenever someone is killed on Earth, a light is lit in the skies.
Then Tianoá, as a bacurau, comes down to Earth to eat the flesh of the dead victim.

So, that means... whenever that star shines brighter, someone has been killed?
That's what the legend says.
And then, the bacurau comes to down here to suck the dead's blood?
Yes, Capuchin.
Aahh... I'm not trying to scare you or anything, Ms. Sloth, but that star is shining brighter right nooow!
Capuchin!!
I guess now I know why the ancient civilizations used the sky as a clock.
You know? Why?
Because I have the feeling it is time to run away very faaaast!
Capuchin! Calm down!
Hah hah hah... Oh, that Capuchin.
But I'll be back, Ms. Sloth!
Bye, Capuchin!
